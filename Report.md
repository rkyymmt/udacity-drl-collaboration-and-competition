## Report

- provides a description of the implementation.

- Learning Algorithm
    - The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.

- Plot of Rewards
    - A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that either:
        - [version 1] the agent receives an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +30, or
        - [version 2] the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes, and over all 20 agents) of at least +30.
        - The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.

- Ideas for Future Work
    - The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
